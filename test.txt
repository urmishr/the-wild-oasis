To Whom It May Concern,

This is to confirm that Himadri Patel worked with us as a Registered Practical Nurse (RPN) on a full-time basis (40 hours/week) from February 2024 to December 2024.

As of January 2025, she has continued employment in a casual RPN role. During this time, she has demonstrated professionalism, clinical competence, and dedication to patient care.

We appreciate her contributions and look forward to continued collaboration.
